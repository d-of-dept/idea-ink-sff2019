  <div class="copy copy-1">
    <p>For every person that says “I can’t draw to save my life,” or that “You’re so talented!”, when they see a person drawing with confidence – I can, with full authority, tell you two things.</p>
    <p><strong>One:</strong> Drawing, like writing, and arithmetic, is a skill that can be taught – and hence, learnt.</p>
    <p><strong>Two:</strong> Like your first gym session, or cycling attempt, drawing is a psychomotor skill – which
requires practice, and can be built gradually, over time.</p>
    <p>Forget what you learnt in art classes at school: that art is a vaunted privilege for the talented few, belonging within the white-washed gallows of modern art galleries.
</p>
    <p>What we are dealing with today, is functional image-making. From your profile pictures on LinkedIn, to every PowerPoint slide deck, PDF file, and Outlook e-mail that passes through your fingertips, we are dealing with a world of pixels – where your medium may have already drowned out your message.<br></p>
    <p>For every Millennial and Gen-Z your company is trying to woo, for every C-suite leader you’re trying to capture precious minutes from – even your own teammates, who might be crossing several time zones and events during a concurrent video call – we are living in an increasingly information-rich, yet attention-poor workplace.&nbsp;<br></p>

    <blockquote class="quote quote-2">So why do good visuals matter?</blockquote>
    <p class="left-quote left-quote-2">“</p>
  </div>
  <div class="copy copy-2">
    <p>Like a good piece of design, good visuals are elegant, compact, useful, and above all else, <em>memorable</em>.</p>
    <p>Good design doesn’t shout; it communicates. The visuals that you use every day – be it an emoji, flowchart, or video – are expressions that will either reinforce, or detract from the message you’re trying to convey.<br></p>
    <p>Unfortunately, whether you like it or not, these visual messages <em>do</em> represent your ideas – your thought process – and sometimes, even your work image.<br></p>
    <p>The ability to communicate memorably is a skill that requires discipline, craft, and constant effort. It is something that will augment and strengthen good ideas, and powerful strategies.</p>
    <p>While we are taught not to judge a book by its cover, there are indeed times where we only get about five seconds to issue one key message, to draw a crowded room’s attention, or to impose upon the urgency of a particular context, challenge, or solution.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At Idea Ink, we are trained precisely to rise to this occasion; to parse and synthesize complexity into succinct visual images.

    <p class="copy">By breaking down the concept of visual intelligence – which is the ability to communicate visually,
functionally – into three practical layers, we hope to give busy managers simple work tools, which would help you not just survive, but better still, thrive, in a world that’s drowning with information and not ideas.
